# Smart-Reservoir-Management-System

**📘 Smart Reservoir Management System**
AI-Powered Forecasting & Optimization for Sustainable Water Management

**🚀 Project Overview**
This project implements a Smart Reservoir Management System to forecast inflow discharge and optimize water outflow using AI and Genetic Algorithms. The goal is to enhance water conservation, reduce wastage by up to 30%, and enable data-driven decision-making for dam operators.

**🏆 Key Features**
✅ LSTM-based inflow prediction (next 7 days)
✅ Genetic Algorithm to optimize outflow schedule
✅ Data visualization: pie charts, bar charts, line plots, heatmaps
✅ 30-day historical trends for rainfall & inflow
✅ Correlation analysis for data insights

**📂 Dataset**
CSV file containing:

**⚙️ How it Works**
1️⃣ Preprocess and scale the data
2️⃣ Train an LSTM model for inflow discharge forecasting
3️⃣ Predict inflow for the next 7 days
4️⃣ Optimize outflow schedule using Genetic Algorithm
5️⃣ Visualize results for informed water release decisions

**📈 Results**
7-day inflow forecasts with high accuracy

Optimized outflow plan to minimize wastage

30% potential improvement in water release efficiency

**🌍 Impact**
Supports sustainable dam operations by enabling predictive, optimized water management. Helps reduce overflow risk and ensures efficient water use for communities and agriculture.
